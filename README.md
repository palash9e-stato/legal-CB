# legal-CB


This project is an **AI-powered Legal Chatbot** developed over **5 days**, designed to answer legal queries through a **text-based interface**. Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Google’s Gemini AI API**, it allows users to type in legal questions and receive clear, context-aware responses generated by the model. The chatbot focuses on simplifying complex legal concepts and providing quick, reliable insights in real time.

Currently, the system supports **only text input**, but future updates aim to include **document upload** and **voice-based query support** for enhanced accessibility. With its clean Streamlit interface and powerful NLP capabilities, this project demonstrates how AI can assist in legal understanding and research, making legal knowledge more approachable for everyone.
